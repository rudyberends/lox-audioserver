   * reacting to the two fields separately sent two SetVolumes per event, and on renderers that
   * flip Mute alongside volume (Bose SoundTouch) it doubled the very echoes that fed the
   * oscillation of issue #358.
   *
   * An event arriving before any level is known (no write yet, nothing evented) only seeds: it
   * is the GENA initial state dump, not a user change. An unchanged level is a keep-alive/renew
   * snapshot (issue #314, stiwy18) and stays silent. A level that matches a recent write of ours
   * is our own echo — recorded, never answered. A change reported while we are moving the
   * renderer's transport is its own transition noise (0 at Stop, a self-restored level after
   * SetURI) — recorded, not adopted; onStreamFetched re-asserts the zone's level if the device
   * drifted. What remains is a genuine device-side change, which the zone adopts; its answering
   * dispatch back to us lands in the echo window, so the exchange converges instead of
   * oscillating.
