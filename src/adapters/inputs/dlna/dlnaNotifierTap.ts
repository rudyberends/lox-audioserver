/**
 * Fans zone-state changes out to the per-zone DLNA renderers.
 *
 * Every zone with the DLNA input enabled advertises itself as a UPnP
 * MediaRenderer, and a control point that subscribes to one (Home Assistant's
 * `dlna_dmr`, BubbleUPnP, a TV) expects to be told what that zone is doing.
 * The renderer only ever hears about the casts it received itself, so without
 * this decorator it reports whatever it was last *asked* to do — `STOPPED` for
 * the whole life of a zone nobody ever cast to, while the zone happily plays.
 *
 * Same shape and same reason as `withApiEvents`: sitting in front of the one
 * internal zone-change signal means no future emit path can forget to reflect.
 * Every method is forwarded explicitly rather than spread, so a new port method
 * is a compile error here instead of a silently dropped notification.
